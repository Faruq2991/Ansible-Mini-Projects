# Virtual Hosts Configuration

## Overview
Write a simple Ansible Playbook to install Apache2 and Nginx web servers.
This project introduced me to some very important concepts in Ansible and how to further make 
my configuration and automation tasks easier, and neater by consolidating and better task management with the introduction of handlers.
