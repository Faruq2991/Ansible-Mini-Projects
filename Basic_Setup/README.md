# Learning Outcome

I learned some basic yet very important concepts of Ansible from executing this mini project:

- Project: Set up Ansible on your local machine and create an inventory file. [x]
- Goals of the project:
 - [*]Install Ansible. [x]
 - [*]Create a basic inventory file with at least two different hosts.[x]
 - [x]Use Ansible ad-hoc commands to ping the hosts and check connectivity.[x]
   I used `ansible all --key-file ~/.ssh/ansible -i inventory -m ping` to check for connectivity and communication.

## Skills Learned:
1. Ansible Installation.
1. Inventory Management.
1. basic ad-hoc commands.
